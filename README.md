# Account Archiver
This project parses account information from a data file and indexes the information into an elastic search database, and then allows the user to make API calls to retrieve and modify information in the database. The AWS services API Gateway, Lambda, Elasticsearch, and Cloudwatch were used to create this project, but only the python code is included.
